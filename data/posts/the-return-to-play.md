For me, the goal of writing is just to vomit words, you know? Just to set them free, as if they had to be said, as if there was a voice inside me that was telling me: It is time for these words to be free. It is time for you to set them free.

The most natural way on which that happens for me is writing like this.

Unraveling my thoughts in this stream of consciousness that seems to have no end, no direction, no meaning, and no explanation. I come here with the absolute intention of writing the story of sadhana, of telling the story of this new world on which our inner childs will meet each other, but I end up in this void, in this maze, of my own mind, trying to explain something that cannot be explained, trying to find a meaning that cannot be found.

Or yes? Can it be found? That’s the question that comes to mind, as if in the writing of this story there was an opportunity, a window, for understanding with more clarity what is the story that wants to be told through my words.

Because there is a story that wants to be told, and it is the story of all those children that were pushed down when they were growing up. All of those stories of games that were not played because there was a way of being that was important to live up to. There was a certain set of protocols that was important to keep in place.

So many stories that were not told, so many quests that were not explored, so many hide and seeks that were buried below the need that your parents had for you to be someone specific. “You need to grow like this, and I will shape you as I want. As I feel it is going to be the most beneficial for you in the future.”

Guess what:

It was not the most beneficial thing. When a human being is growing up, the only thing that it needs is acceptance, it is a warm environment on which to feel that he is loved, needed, cared for. To feel that she can be herself. But as we start to grow up, there is an exploration that doesn’t happen completely, because of all the expectations that are in place in relationship to what society expects from us. From our parents, outwards. So we go deeper into the maze of expectations, which end up being the source of suffering.

Out parents expect us to be someone specific, and in that, we end up carrying the burden of having to be. Instead of experiencing what it is to just be. We carry on with this weight in our chest, of those stories that were not told. Of those memories that wanted to be lived but were not. Or maybe not, I’m trying to explain something that can’t be explained here, and It really doesn’t matter. Because what is real is that history was how it was, and now it is time to write it again.

How am I going to help re-write it? Which is the grain of sand that I will add to this whole equation so that I can move towards where my heart tells me?

I will not talk about the pain that the inner child of people has. I will not complain about what happened before. I will not try to change history. Nope. That is not my game to play.

My game is about telling a new story. It is about sparking the light within the child that is inside you, by tapping into your creative capacity.

By helping you play.

We need more play in the world, and it is just about time to realize that. We need to have more fun, we need to connect with that inner child, to remember that he is in there. No matter how wounded she can be. That is part of reality, and if we embrace it there can be a transformation in society that comes from that new relationship with ourselves.

I don’t want to complain about what happened.

I want to absolutely embrace it, and from there, build a new future. So that we can learn from what happened. So that we can come up with a new story.

That’s why I’m building sadhana. I want to learn how to play again. I believe that creativity is the source from which this inner child experiences deep joy, and the end result of what I envision with sadhana is the meeting of creators with their followers, so that they can together participate in challenges that will remind each human being that participates in them that they are a creator. We have always been creators that just want to play, it is just that we have forgotten it.

So what is what I envision happening? For example, you admire a person that cooks incredible meals. What if that person came up with a 3 day challenge on which to cook a new meal every day, from scratch, with whatever ingredient you find in your kitchen? What if that challenge was just to explore your creativity through the act of cooking a nice meal for your family? Without a pre-conceived goal. Without the need for doing things right.

That has been the major killer of our inner child. That incessant need for fitting by doing things right.

Polarity is not part of the future that I envision, because it is the source of misery.

If you label the consequences of your creative act as bad, if you label yourself as ‘bad’ at doing the thing, you will end up quitting. I suck at doing this thing, therefore I quit.

Have you been there?

That is at the opposite end of the road of learning how to play. Of playing. If you approach the creative act with the perspective of play, of having fun, you will end up encountering yourself in an exploration that will transform you, from the inside out. You will open up to explore. Playing is about exploring.

It’s not about rights or wrongs. Its about being surprised by what came out of you.

I remember a great podcast from Andrew Huberman, on which he spoke about play. He said that animals learn how to experience life through play. By playing, we discover which are our boundaries. By playing, we learn how to relate to our peers. By playing, we discover which are the limits of our physical body, and the capacity that we have of exerting a particular amount of movement. We find our limits. We melt our limits.

We melt our limits into the act of being.

That’s the power of play. It is an invitation into just being, and what I’m bringing into the world concretely with sadhana is that. An invitation to just being, using the creative act, using play, as the catalyzer for you to develop the capacity for being present.

For just being.

I’m absolutely sincere on this, and I’m here to manifest this into a reality. I have done so much inner work in these last years, always peeling out the layers of who think I am, going deeper into the exploration of what this thing called life really is. I have done everything that I have encountered to go there, and you know what?

The answer is creativity. The answer is play. The answer is to approach life with beginner’s mindset, and in that, there is no one more capable of doing that than our children.

It is time for us to see our children as the most important elements of society. It is time to see our children as the ones that hold the wisdom that we forgot in this incessant quest of ‘being someone’. Of achieving something specific that will eventually free us from the burden of being who we are.

It is time to learn from all the stories and come up with a new one: we already are everything that we came to be.

Play will show us the way.

Exploring yourself through the creative act will give you the answers.

It is time to show up. For you, for your kids, and for each kid in the world. They need us.

Thank you for being who you are.

If you enjoyed reading this, please comment something below. You don’t know how valuable it is to receive any comment. What I’m doing is hard, trying to push through the noise of my own self doubt in the quest of bringing something new to the world.

A new story.

Your support means a lot, and besides from commenting, just go to www.sadhana.lat/s/new and create a challenge in there. Invite your friends, show up to create, to play, and give me the feedback that I need to evolve that thing into something awesome.

We are going to build this together.
