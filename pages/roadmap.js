          This is where I reveal the plans and aspirations for the future of
          Sadhana, a place where you can get a sneak peek into the path I intend
          to forge with this project.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the core of my vision is a simple, yet profound belief: Learning
          happens through doing. The world is evolving, and with it, the ways we
          understand and value education are changing. The age-old tradition of
          learning through experience is re-emerging, breathing new life into
          our understanding of what it means to be educated.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to create a world where doing the work, showing up every
          day, and being consistent in your pursuits is recognized and valued.
          To this end, I plan on introducing certificates in the form of
          Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a testament to your dedication and
          consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          These NFTs won&apos;t be your traditional certificates. Instead, they
          will be symbols of your commitment, your journey, and the work
          you&apos;ve put into your Sadhana. These tokens will be a new form of
          credentials that you can proudly display in your crypto wallet, a
          testament to the work you&apos;ve done, the growth you&apos;ve
          experienced, and the path you&apos;ve walked alongside your favorite
          creators and their community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a world where your degree isn&apos;t a piece of paper that
          merely attests to the fact that you had the resources to go to a
          specific school, but a collection of tokens that represent your actual
          experiences, your actual work, your actual learning. This is the world
          I aim to build with Sadhana.
        </p>

        <p>The roadmap to this future consists of several key steps:</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 1:</strong> Building a community of learners and
          creators, a place where individuals can engage in Sadhanas and start
          their journeys of transformation. Iterating on the web application, to
          truly understand which are the needs from a place like this, so that
          it can be as valuable as it can be for the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 2:</strong> Introducing NFT certificates as a testament
          to the work and learning of our community members.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 3:</strong> Expanding the platform into a mobile
          application to allow creators to connect with their audience in new
          and meaningful ways, opening doors and encouraging commitment and
          accountability.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 4:</strong> Continuously improving and refining the
          platform based on feedback and the evolving needs of our community, to
          create an environment that best supports learning through doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for considering being part of this journey. Your
          participation, whether as a learner, a creator, or a supporter, is
          crucial to making this vision a reality. I&apos;m excited to build
          this future together, step by step, in the spirit of Sadhana: through
          consistent, dedicated practice.
